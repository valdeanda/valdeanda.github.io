**About me**

 I have always been fascinated by the remarkable metabolic versatility of the microbial world. Microorganisms have been evolving for 4 billion years, developing the most extant complex pathways and an outstanding metabolic diversity, which has allowed for the continued persistence of every form of life on Earth. Learning this as an undergraduate student became a turning point for my career interests, and since then, I have focused much of my studies on deciphering the first metabolism that appeared on Earth, the extreme limits of life, and the reactions carried out by microorganisms that make life possible on Earth

Microorganisms are the most abundant and diverse form of life on Earth; however, understanding their metabolic capabilities has been hampered by low-resolution analytical approaches. With advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, we are now able to gain new information on the microbial metabolic capabilities directly from environmental samples and yet, we still face challenges associated with the accumulation and analysis of massive amounts of data. Overcoming these computational and biological “roadblocks” was one of my goals during my doctoral dissertation. As a grad student in the Ecology Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (IE-UNAM) and in collaboration with the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS-UNAM) and the Spanish National Research Council (EEAD-CSIC), I led the development of a new computational tool (Multigenomic Entropy-Based Score or MEBS). [MEBS](https://github.com/valdeanda/mebs) is an open-source algorithm which synthesizes genomic information into a single informative value that predicts the likelihood that microbial taxa or entire communities perform specific metabolic-biogeochemical pathways. MEBS provides an open-access, reproducible platform to efficiently organize and simplify complex genomic data to better understand the metabolisms of diverse microbial taxa [De Anda et al., 2017](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/11/gix096/4561660)

 My current postdoctoral research efforts at the [Marine Science Institute UTMSI](https://utmsi.utexas.  edu/), working in [Baker's lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/baker-lab/author/bb34996/), focus on expanding the tree of life by identifying unknown lineages of microorganisms from extreme environments (e.g., hydrothermal vent systems and hot springs) and predicting their potential role in the environment using MEBS and other state-of-the-art genomic techniques. Filling the gaps in the tree of life not only provides a better understanding of the biogeochemistry and evolution of life on the planet, but can also help us to understand how humans and other life forms on Earth (including those we are yet to discover) can withstand anthropogenic climate change.

In the social aspect, I want to become a role model for women in Latin America, empowering female scientists with diverse backgrounds by sharing my story, as I recently did in the [Women in Science Conference in China](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qq4L_XLYLDdQ-bOWWxKY8Q) fostering collaborations with female researchers from under-represented regions.  During this conference I had the opportunity to talk about the number of challenges throughout our professional careers, including gender inequality, violence, poverty, stereotyping, and social and cultural restrictions that limit our access to education and funding for scientific research. More specifically, I want to generate exposure about the inequality in science by generating closeness between citizens and female scientists through science education and active participation within the community. Also, I want to work with other women in STEM to encourage future generations to not give up in perusing their dreams. I am determined to pass on my knowledge to underrepresented groups in science, especially Latina women and other minority groups. I find it especially important to share my experiences with other women about skills that are typically conducted by men, such as code engineering and software development
