# Giovannelli Lab Website

This is the website of our academic research group at the University of Naples "Federico II". Ypou can access the site at [https://dgiovannelli.github.io/](https://dgiovannelli.github.io/)

This website was forked from the Allan Lab website [http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. The Allan Lab tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for me and you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes. Visit their website for instruction on how to do it, or go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modify this page for your purpose.
