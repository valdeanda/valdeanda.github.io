  <p>Year by the numbers
In 2016 I decided to post publicly each year a summary of my scientific activities. I was inspired by Piet Hut, my host at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, who’s posting every year detailed yearly report of his activities. I think this benefits both myself, as it bring into focus what I’ve been spending my time on during the year, and the public at large, since my science is largely funded with taxpayers money it is good to be transparent about the activities carried out.</p>
